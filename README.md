Hello ðŸ‘‹ 
--------
I'm Karina Palomino, an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Pure Mathematics! I find anything and everything about math fascinating,
so much so I wish to further my knowledge in it through computer science! 

At the moment I am currently learning the languages Python and Julia. Both of which will be useful in having a deeper understanding of the logic 
behind mathematics as well as help in building experience in coding.

Apart from utilizing GitHub to keep record of my projects, I am still building on my experience, thus I hope to attract opportunities on here to help me grow!
