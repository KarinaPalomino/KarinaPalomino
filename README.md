Hello ðŸ‘‹ 
--------
I'm Karina Palomino, an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Pure Mathematics! I find anything and everything about math fascinating,
so much so I wish to further my knowledge in it through coding projects! Apart from building my knowledge, through these projects I will be able to demonstrate my unique approach to complex problems and the process in which I take to solve such problems. 

Despite my limited experience in coding, I am undeterred in my determination to master it. Every coding challenge I undertake is an opportunity to demonstrate my unwavering love for learning and my unyielding grit. With each project, I aim not only to solve problems but also to cultivate my skills and push the boundaries of my capabilities.
